# Cohort of Thrones with Rabbits in Wonderland 

Our project allows administrators and project managers the ability to easily add and update student information while tracking student pairings. We aim to simplify the task of managing students to administrators, project managers, mentors,and so on, by various dashboards and splash pages for students to view their daily pairing.

## What is this?

This is a full-stack web app created by two former full-time Thinkful students, Sonja and Avi, made with love for our project managers to simplify their life when it comes to creating and showing daily pairs. 

Students can view their daily pair for the day on one page. Administrators and project managers can add, remove, or update student information. Mentors and TA's are able to add comments and notes to each daily pairing.
